**CS 225 Data Structures**

**Team Contract (gkk2-grantrh2-abramig2-pitocco2)**

**Communication**



1. **Team Meetings**
    1. We will plan on meeting once a week, preferably on Saturday at 12 PM. 
    2. Each meeting’s length will depend on the content being covered, but will most likely range from 30 minutes to an hour. 
    3. We plan on using Discord as our main communication channel. 
    4. We will individually be taking notes on things deemed to be important. For example if one aspect of the project is particularly relevant to somebody, that person will be held accountable for knowing that information. 
2. **Assistance**
    1. Our first line of communication we will utilize for assistance during the project is through our Discord Server we created for the project. 
    2. We will hold ourselves to the standard of responding to the Server within 4 hours to accommodate varying schedules between groupmates.
3. **Respect**
    1. In order to ensure that every member will listen and engage with the thoughts of others, we will be practicing two beneficial team norms - not interrupting or judging others' ideas without significant thought and making it habitual to have everyone give updates of their progress at the beginning of our meetings. These will combine to create a non-judgemental space open to new ideas. 
    2. Giving each other ownership over specific tasks will also be important to guaranteeing team buy-in and high quality output. In order to fully hand things off to each other, team trust will be necessary, which will be built over the course of the project. 

**Collaboration**



1. **Work Distribution**
    1. We will assign workload for the following week at each meeting. We will first plan out the things that need to be done as a group for the next week then determine who wants to do each deliverable for the following week. This allows every team member to voice their desires on what they would like to work on.
    2. We will address unforeseen work by immediately notifying the other group members that a certain task is a larger workload than previously decided and we will decide if the task should be split up immediately or extended to the next week.
2. **Time Commitment**
    1. To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than three and no more than six hours per week on the project. Some weeks might require more, but we estimate that this will be enough to output high quality work on a consistent basis.
    2. We should not need to account for prior time conflicts regularly as the final project is replacing the time usually given for the Machine Project assigned each week.
    3. If an unforeseen time conflict does arise, we may either split up work or give an extension the following week to help mitigate lost time.
3. **Conflict Resolution**
    1. We will attempt to resolve any conflicts internally as a team. This will involve allocating time at the beginning of meetings for attempted conflict resolution. If team members feel that the issue has not been resolved after two attempts, they will contact course staff. It is encouraged, but not required, to alert the team any time course staff has been contacted.
